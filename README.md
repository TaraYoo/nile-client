### About Nile

Nile is an E-Commerce site that lets users view and purchase one-of-a-kind artwork.
The client site utilizes Boostrap, Handlebars and Toast and is deployed on
Github pages. The API is built using Express.js and MongoDb.

### Future Plans

In future versions, we would like to add a search function in order to search
for specific products.  We would also like to add categorization for products.
